<!-- Notes on what is HTML Boilerplate:
    this is a standrd HTML Boilerplate Code
-its similar to having a code template.
- <!DOCTYPE html> is where we declear document type.This tells the browser when it opens up this file what is the version of html that we're using.
- This doctype tells the browser to open this file as an HTML5 document.
- <html> Tells the browser that everything in between the opening and closing tags is going to be HTML code.
- The <html> consists of a Head <head> and Body <body>
    <head> is part of HTML file that holds infprmation about the webpage and tells the browser how it should handle the page.
        ex: We might have a <Title> tag in here that tells the browser what is the title of this Page. 
- Inside the Head Section you see <meta charset="utf-8">
- There are different types of <meta> elements. This paticular <meta charset="utf-8"> is called a Character set. And the one we are setting it to is UTF-8.
- The meta elements give extra metadata or associated data to your HTML document. In this case we are telling the browser when it opens up this file that all the text inside our webpage is encoded using the UTF-8 encoding system.
- UTF-8 Is the standard encoding that you should be using. 
- The types of meta Attribute are such as Description, Keywords, Author, and Viewport. 
- These meta tags tell the browser how it should render or display the webpage.
- They give info to search engines about the content of the website.
- our search engine looks in the html website and look for certain meta-tags in order to know what your website is about and display it in their search index.

Notes on how to structure text in HTML:
- <p> is a paragraph tag.
    - it has an closing tag </p> 
    - Formats text into a paragraph 
- Italicize your words in html
    - There are two tags <em> and <i> 
        - <em> is the emphasis element 
            - Tells the browser that the woords that are enclosed between it should be stressed/ emphasized.
            - Markd text that has a stress emphasis of its contents.
            - The result is that it makes it look ilalicized.
        - <i> 
            - Only italicizes the text.
            - It only styles the text to make it slanted.
            - Does Not confer any of that empjasis.
    - Its good to always use emphasis instead of Italic because it conveys more information and not just about the style.
- <b> Tag known as the Bold tag.
    - similer to the <i> tag
    - Makes any text that's inbetween bolded. 
    - You should be using a strong tag <strong>
        - <strong> tag gives text strong improtance, and is typically displayed in bold.
        -   rather than using <b> that just styles the text to make it darker than the rest.

Notes on HTML List:
- Creating a bullet list 
- <ul> tag known as The Unordered List (bullet point list)
    - Ul tag encloses all the parts that will be included in the bullit list.
- <li> tag known as list Item 
    - encloses each and every bullet point.
- <ol> tag known as Ordered list ( bullet points with numbers)
    - Ol tag uses number instead of bullet points. 
    - ex: 1. 2. 3. ...exc
    - you can nest an order list in an unorder list. 

Notes On HTML Image Element:
<image src="angela.png>"
IMG= HTML Element
src="angela.png"= HTML Attribute

- An Image tag is a self closing tag. 
    - Does not need to be closed 
- For the Image Element just providing an image tag is not enough.
    - Need to specifiy the source of the image. 
    - It can be a URL (getting it form the internet)
    - It can be a Local Image (same directory as your website)
    - You can use your own image that you saved in yout comput. 
        - instead of adding a url you can add in the image  by its File name. 

Notes on HTML Anchor Tags:
- adding links to our website and create new pages that can be linked to our homepage.
- We know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language 
    - Hypertext: Is a bunch of text documents taht can be linked together using hyperlinks. 
- <a> known as Anchor Tag
    - is has a start and a end tag </a>
    - have different types of attributes
        - The Href attribute creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email address, locations in the same page or anything elas a URL can address.
    - <a href="https://....">Hello</a>
        - a:is the HTML element name (anchor tag) 
        - href: is the HTML attribute which is set tio equal the link destination.
        - "https://....": Is the Link Destination where you take your user when they click on the link. 
        - Between the open tag and the closing tag is the Link Text. 
            - Thats going to be the text underlined and highlighted in blue.
            - The user knows that when they click on this word it will open into a link.
    - If you want to create a sepatate link of your own page you can add a new HTML file to your HTML PersonalSite.
        - when creating the file you can add the HTML:5 (boilerplat template) and add a section that you want to have saperately. 
        - once adding the information go to your original site and a Anchor Tag on to the section that you've set seperately.
- As long as you've got it inside the same folder/ or specify a path for the browser to get to it then you can start linking up your homepage with different website.

Section:3 Intermediate HTML

Notes on HTML Tables:
- <table> known as the Table element. 
    - represents a tabular data that is information presented in a two- dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data. 
    - has a closing tag </table>
    - everything between is the actual content of out table.
    - this creates a simple table. by default your browser will style the table to not have any borders or padding/anything style related. 
    - for the table to hold pieces of data we use <tr>
        - <tr> is called a table row. 
            - has a open andclosing tag </tr>
            - between the open and closing tr tags is where the data for that row is going.
            - this ection of a code will create a simgle row inside our table.
            - With no associated styling.
            - If there's nothing between these two tags then you won't actually see anything appear on screen.
    - <td> is called a table data, our table cells that we create using the td tag. 
        - has a open and closing tag </td>
        - Between the opening and closing tag we place actual data that's going to go into that cell. 
- Tables have Headers,Body and Footers
        - <thead> for Table Head 
            - They have a closing tag </thead>
            - Add some titles to each of our columns.
            - They get formatted by default in Bold. 

        - <tbody> for Table Body 
            - They have a closing tag </tbody>
        - <tfoot>for Table Footer 
            - They haave a closing tah </tfoot>
 - There are no table columns!!! 
        - you're going from top to bottom defining new table rows and inside each row you're putting in individual cells and each cells gets placed horizontally one after the other.
        Creatibg effectively the columns.
        - the main job of the table is to display structured data 
- for table element there's a bunch of attributes like background color, border or cell padding, cell spacing,frame and many more. 
    - to change the table element appearance. however some of the attributes are showen with a thumbs-down next to them. 
    - because all of these sttributes for thr table element are Deprecated. 
            - which means that it's downgraded. No longer recommend you using.

Notes on Using HTML Tables for Layouts:
- Cellspacing 
    - Which defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or pixels. 
    - this attribute is applied both horizontally and vertically.

Notes on HTML Tables Code Challenge:
- Creating a skills section list using the <table> tags. 

Notes on How to Type Emojis:
- on Mac
    - click: Command+ Control+ Space 
    - This is the default shortcut to bring up the emoji keybord.
    - If this does not work, you might have  DIFFERENT KEY BINDING, in that case, go to Edit in the top 
    menue bar abd click on EMOJI & SYMBOLS.
