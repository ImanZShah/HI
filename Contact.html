    Notes on HTML Forms:
    - on the contact section is a bit sparsw at the moment.
    - we can add a form at the end of this where you allow people to put down their name and their email, also 
    message us by using that form. 
    - <form> is a form tag 
        - to define what should go into our form and this by itself doesn't actually do anything.
        inorder for the form to do anything you need two important HTML element and thats the label
        and input. 
        - <Label> Name:</label>
            - Between the opening and closing label tags
            you can write some text taht will be displayed as a label inside your form. 
        - <Input> 
            - Is a self closing tag
            -  you can define input by using the Type Attribute. 
            - <input type="text"/>
                - There's a whole bunch of input types that you can tag into to use
                inside your form. 
                - in this example the input type is set to text so we get a textbox where the user can 
                input their name. 
            - <input type="submit"/>
                - this creates a button 
    - By setting the attribute type to varoues predefined key words, you actually end up with completely different things
    on your website. 
    - when looking at the MDN docs you'll see that there's loads of different keywords that you can use.
